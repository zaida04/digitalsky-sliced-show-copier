This collection of utilities was created for a DigitalSky renderer PC setup. At its current state, DarkMatter is a buggy and sometimes lacking piece of software, which this utility aims to solve by providing missing functionality.

## üìú Scripts
### [`sliced-show-copier`](https://github.com/zaida04/digitalsky-util-scripts/blob/main/show-copier)
**Location:** [`show-copier/`](https://github.com/zaida04/digitalsky-util-scripts/blob/main/show-copier/main.py)  
**Description:** Copy all the sliced files corresponding to a renderer from one dir on the renderer to another.  

The purpose for this tool is to help move show `.dsi` and `.mpg` files split into 7 parts from one folder on a renderer to another folder on that same renderer and to also copy it to the `DS-MASTER` computer. Made so that others can easily adapt it for their own setup by simply editing the `render_pc_paths` list.
